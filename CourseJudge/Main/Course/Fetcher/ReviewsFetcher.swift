This professor wants all his students to succeed without a doubt. The midterms are very easy because he gives us some past midterms to practice with and he structures his midterms the same way every year, so you know exactly what to expect going into midterms. As long as you work, you'll be more than fine."),

He is literally the textbook(a simplified one) Don't skip classes. Homework can be a lot but it's perfect practice for midterm and finals(guaranteed). Would have gotten an A+ but I am fund of tiny mistakes and laziness. I highly recommend him. Perfect professor, you can't get less than an A+ in anything he teaches unless you're just unwilling to do anything."),
